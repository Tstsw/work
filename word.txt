Campaigners say the increasing sexualisation of society, 

fuelled by easy access to internet pornography, is behind 

the disturbing figures.

Only yesterday the National Union of Teachers warned that 

sexual equality has been ¡®rebranded by big business¡¯ into 

a ¡®raunch culture¡¯ which is damaging the way girls view 

themselves.

Playboy bunnies adorn children¡¯s pencil cases, pole dancing 

is portrayed as an ¡®empowering¡¯ form of exercise and 

beauty pageants have become a staple of student life, 

delegates said.

Statistics from the Department for Education show that in 

2009/10, there were 3,330 exclusions for sexual misconduct. 

In 2010/11, a further 3,030 children were excluded for the 

same reason.

The 6,000-plus cases cover lewd behaviour, sexual abuse, 

assault, bullying, daubing sexual graffiti, and sexual 

harassment.

The 2010/11 total includes 200 exclusions from primary 

schools: 190 suspensions and ten expulsions.

There have been warnings that the number of expulsions may 

only hint at the true scale of the problem.

England¡¯s deputy children¡¯s commissioner has told MPs that 

head teachers are reluctant to tackle sexual exploitation of 

children for fear of the message it will send out about 

their schools. 

Sue Berelowitz said schools were not facing up to the fact 

that some bullying amounts to sexual violence.
